# repo-template

A generic Git repository template for my projects, endowed with some basic
scripts stolen from other work I've done. The eventual goal is for most/all of
my GitHub repositories to resemble this one, or at least to be as thorough (or
more) in content and functionality.

## Installation

Clone this repository (e.g., using `git clone
git@github.com:generic-github-user/repo-template.git`) and install any
necessary [dependencies](#dependencies); if you want to make changes to this
template, I recommend
[forking](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) the
repo first, then cloning your fork. Note that if you create your own fork,
you'll be able to [set it as a template
repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-template-repository)
for your GitHub profile and use it to initialize other repositories.

## Usage

Modify your clone or fork of this repository as needed to suit your project
(see the [Installation](#installation) section for more information). If you're
unsure what code editor to use, I recommend [Neovim](https://neovim.io/).
